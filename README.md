RAG - Multi-Query Query translation

Besides using the LangChain Chain/Pipeline as illustrated in the LangChain Rag tutorial below, 
this program also creates a step-to-step-query function that executes within the same logic 
but without the abstract of Chain/Pipeline. it helps me to understand the processes 
and also be able to improve the prompt or question preparation better. 
Of course, langSmith is a great tool as well

Please review the RAG tutorial from Langchain in details (part 5 - multi-query query translation)
